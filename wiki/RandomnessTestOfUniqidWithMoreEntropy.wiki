= Introduction =

The page contains the results of some statistical randomness tests on uniqid function with more entropy enabled.
Tests have been accomplished by [http://www.fourmilab.ch/random/ ENT].

= Code used in Tests =
{{{
<?
for($i=0;$i<100000;$i++)
{
	printf("%25X",uniqid(rand(),true));
}
?>
}}}

{{{
  Entropy = 7.548771 bits per byte.

  Optimum compression would reduce the size of this 200000 byte file by 5 percent.

  Chi square distribution for 200000 samples is 150006.14, and randomly would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the times.

  Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.2513 (127.5 = random).
  
  Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.149911499 (error 0.26 percent).
  
  Serial correlation coefficient is -0.000192 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
